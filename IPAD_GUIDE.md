# Envion on PlugData for iPadOS/iOS

[If you are on Desktop select this URL](https://www.peamarte.it/env/envion_v3.6.html)

## üì± Quick Start Guide

**Good news!** Envion works perfectly on PlugData for iPadOS and iOS devices. The core functionality is fully operational without requiring any additional library installations.

## Understanding the Dependency Warnings

When you open Envion on PlugData for iPadOS, you may see warning messages about missing dependencies. **Don't worry ‚Äî this is completely normal and expected!**
## iPadOS Sandbox Notes

On iPadOS, PlugData runs inside its own **sandbox**.  
This means it cannot access arbitrary folders on your device ‚Äî it can only read and write inside its own **Documents directory**.  

### Why this matters
If the `audio/` or `data/` folders are placed outside of the sandbox, PlugData will show errors such as:
[soundfiler] read ... Operation not permitted
can't open file ...

### How to fix it
- Copy the **entire Envion repository** (including `audio/` and `data/`) into the PlugData sandbox.  
- You can do this via:
  - **Finder/iTunes File Sharing** (PlugData ‚Üí Documents)  
  - **iCloud Drive** (place the folder in `PlugData/`)  
  - **Files app** (any location accessible by PlugData)  
- Always use **relative paths** (e.g. `./audio/sample.wav`) instead of absolute system paths.  
  This ensures PlugData looks for files in the same folder as the patch, fully compatible with iPadOS.

### What the warnings mean:

The warnings refer to these external libraries:
- `ggee`
- `ceammc`
- `simplex`
- `audiolab`

These libraries are:
1. **Optional** ‚Äî they add extra features but are not required
2. **Desktop-only** ‚Äî they cannot be installed on iPadOS/iOS through PlugData
3. **Safe to ignore** ‚Äî you can dismiss these warnings and use Envion normally

## What Works on iPadOS (Without Additional Libraries)

‚úÖ **Full envelope sequencing** ‚Äî All dynatext functionality  
‚úÖ **Audio playback** ‚Äî Complete sample manipulation and playback  
‚úÖ **All presets** ‚Äî Load and use all included presets  
‚úÖ **Recording** ‚Äî Real-time recording of your output  
‚úÖ **Manual triggers** ‚Äî KEY-1 through KEY-5 controls  
‚úÖ **Automatic mode** ‚Äî Random list and random terna selection  
‚úÖ **Stretch controls** ‚Äî Time-stretching and envelope scaling  
‚úÖ **Matrix mixer** ‚Äî All routing and mixing features  
‚úÖ **Effects** ‚Äî Echo, reverb, distortion (Nuke module)  

## What Requires Optional Libraries (Desktop Only)

‚ö†Ô∏è **3D scope visualization** ‚Äî Requires `simplex` library  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Advanced audio features** ‚Äî Some enhanced features require `audiolab`  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Extended utilities** ‚Äî Certain additional features require `ceammc` and `ggee`

**Important:** The absence of these libraries does not affect the core envelope sequencing, sample playback, or preset functionality of Envion.

## Built-in Libraries

PlugData includes these libraries by default (on all platforms including iPadOS):

‚úì **cyclone** ‚Äî Used for gate~ objects and routing  
‚úì **else** ‚Äî Used for LFO, reverb, note labels, and various utilities  

These built-in libraries provide all the essential functionality for Envion to work properly.

## How to Use Envion on iPadOS

1. **Download** the Envion repository and transfer the patch files to your iPad
2. **Open** `___ Envion_v3.9_Plugdata_WIN-Ipad.pd` in PlugData for iPadOS
3. **Dismiss** any dependency warning dialogs that appear
4. **Load a sample** using the "BROWSE audio" button
5. **Turn on DSP** (if not already on)
6. **Play presets** from the bottom-right preset section, or
7. **Use manual triggers** with KEY-1 to KEY-5

## Transferring Files to iPadOS

You can transfer Envion files to your iPad using:
- **iCloud Drive** ‚Äî Place files in your PlugData folder
- **Airdrop** ‚Äî Send files directly from a Mac
- **Files app** ‚Äî Use any cloud storage service (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
- **iTunes File Sharing** ‚Äî Transfer via USB connection

Once transferred, open the `.pd` files directly in PlugData.

## Performance Tips for iPadOS
- **Start with preset** ‚Äî The presets work fine ‚Äî let me know if anything‚Äôs wrong
- **Monitor CPU usage** ‚Äî Some iPads may struggle with very complex patches
- **Close other apps** ‚Äî Free up system resources for better performance
- **Adjust buffer size** ‚Äî In PlugData settings, if audio glitches occur

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Dependency warnings appear on startup
**Solution:** This is normal! Simply dismiss the warnings and continue using the patch.

### Problem: No sound is produced
**Solution:** 
- Check that DSP is turned ON (toggle in PlugData)
- Verify that a sample is loaded into the buffer
- Ensure your iPad volume is up and PlugData has audio permissions

### Problem: Patch won't load
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're using the PlugData version: `___ Envion_v4.0_Plugdata.pd`
- Verify you have the latest version of PlugData for iOS
- Check that the file wasn't corrupted during transfer

### Problem: Missing preset files
**Solution:**
- Ensure you transferred the entire Envion folder structure
- The `/data` folder contains all the envelope preset files (dynatext)
- The `/audio` folder contains sample audio files
