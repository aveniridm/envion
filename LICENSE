Additional Legal & Ethical Notice
Envion’s *NET-AUDIO* and *NET-SOUND* modules fetch tiny audio fragments
from open archives such as Internet Archive and Freesound.org,
using only their public web interfaces.
No audio is stored, copied, or redistributed by the software —
all sounds are streamed directly from their original sources.

Each fragment remains subject to the license defined by its host.
Users are responsible for verifying the applicable rights if any
retrieved material is later recorded, published, or redistributed
as part of a composition.

This tool promotes an ethos of procedural, ephemeral sampling —
encouraging listening, exploration, and respect for the authors
and archives that make these resources available.
