# Envion

**Envion** is an ecosystem in Pure Data designed for algorithmic composition, musique concrÃ¨te, and experimental sound processing.  
It includes tools for slicing, dynamic envelopes, texture generation, and multi-channel management.

## ðŸ“‚ Project structure

- `Envion_v3.6.pd` â†’ main patch  
- `astrazioni-non-obbligatorie/` â†’ optional subpatches and utilities  
- `audio/` â†’ test samples and audio files (small, uploadable to GitHub)  
- `data/` â†’ data and presets for slicing/algorithms  
- `html-guide/` â†’ guides and documentation (also in HTML/CSS format)  
- `legacy version/` â†’ previous versions  
- `other version/` â†’ experimental variants  
- `preset.pd` â†’ example of preset management

## The concept of *Terne*

One of the central elements of **Envion** is the use of *terne* (triplets of numerical values).  
Each terna defines the behavior of a sound fragment through three main parameters:

1. **Duration** â€“ relative or absolute time of the event (in ms or scaling factor).  
2. **Amplitude** â€“ the signal level, which can be constant or shaped by an envelope.  
3. **Offset / Position** â€“ the reading point or starting position of the fragment within the sample.

### ðŸ”¹ Examples of terne

0.452  80  0     ; â†’ 452 ms duration, amplitude 80, offset at start of sample
0.210  45  600   ; â†’ 210 ms duration, amplitude 45, offset 600 ms into the sample
0.879  100 1280  ; â†’ 879 ms duration, full amplitude, offset 1280 ms


## âš¡ Quick Start

1. **Load a list** from **Dynatext Cloud** (or select a local `.txt` in `data/`).  
2. **Browse a sample** (WAV) and assign it as the playback buffer.  
3. **Turn on DSP** and explore.

- Use the **manual triggers** and sliders to test sequences.  
- Adjust the **stretch factor** to compress/expand time.  
- Try the **ready-made presets** (bottom area).
