# Envion

**Envion** is an ecosystem in Pure Data designed for algorithmic composition, musique concrÃ¨te, and experimental sound processing.  
It includes tools for slicing, dynamic envelopes, texture generation, and multi-channel management.

## The concept of *Terne*

One of the central elements of **Envion** is the use of *terne* (triplets of numerical values).  
Each terna defines the behavior of a sound fragment through three main parameters:

1. **Duration** â€“ relative or absolute time of the event (in ms or scaling factor).  
2. **Amplitude** â€“ the signal level, which can be constant or shaped by an envelope.  
3. **Offset / Position** â€“ the reading point or starting position of the fragment within the sample.

Together, these three coordinates generate micro-articulations that Envion translates into envelopes and slicing processes.  
The *terne* thus work as a kind of **algorithmic score**, where the sum of hundreds or thousands of triplets allows the creation of complex text
